<h1>Resistance Mechanism Analysis</h1>
<p>Here we explore different hypotheses for the resistance mechanisms observed in a K. pneumoniae strain. The hypotheses are evaluated based on the observed resistance pattern, which includes high resistance to Pip Tazo and aztreonam, cefepime resistance, high resistance to ceftazidime, and resistance to carbapenems (especially ertapenem).</p>

<div class="branch">
    <div class="header">1. ESBL mediated resistance</div>
    <p>Originally suspected due to patient history. However, the phenotype is now ESBL negative. Additionally, aztreonam resistance is present.</p>
    <div class="conclusion">Conclusion: Unlikely ðŸŒŸ</div>
</div>

<div class="branch">
    <div class="header">2. AmpC mediated resistance</div>
    <p>Could explain cephalosporin resistance, including cefepime. But, it cannot explain aztreonam resistance.</p>
    <div class="conclusion">Conclusion: Unlikely ðŸŒŸ</div>
</div>

<div class="branch">
    <div class="header">3. Carbapenemase mediated resistance</div>
    <p>Carba NP test is negative. However, we can't rule out carbapenemase not detected by the test, e.g., OXA-48.</p>
    <div class="conclusion">Conclusion: Possible ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ</div>
</div>

<div class="branch">
    <div class="header">4. Porin loss</div>
    <p>Could explain resistance to ertapenem and cephalosporins. However, it typically wouldn't confer aztreonam resistance.</p>
    <div class="conclusion">Conclusion: Possible ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ</div>
</div>

<div class="branch">
    <div class="header">5. Combined Mechanisms</div>
    <p>The resistance profile could be due to a combination of factors, such as a carbapenemase along with ESBLs or AmpC beta-lactamases, and a porin loss.</p>
    <div class="conclusion">Conclusion: Likely ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ</div>
</div>
